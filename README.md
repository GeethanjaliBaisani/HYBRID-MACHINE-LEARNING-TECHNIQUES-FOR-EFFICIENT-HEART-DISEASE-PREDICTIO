One of the dominant causes of death in the world is cardiovascular heart disease. Cardiovascular disease prediction presents a significant challenge for clinical data analysis. With the use of machine learning (ML), it has been established that it is possible to make predictions and judgments from the large amounts of clinical data generated by the healthcare sector. Additionally, we have observed the employment of ML approaches in recent advancements across several IoT domains (IoT). Only a few researches have looked into using ML to predict cardiac disease. In this study, by applying machine learning approaches to uncover critical traits, we propose a novel method to increase the accuracy of cardiovascular disease prediction
